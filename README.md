# Smart Bus Booking

SmartBusBooking is an advanced web application built with ReactJS to streamline ticketing and pass management for bus rapid transit systems.
Designed for both daily commuters and new passengers, the platform integrates multiple modules into a clean, intuitive interface, making travel planning and ticket purchasing effortless.

The backend is powered by a MySQL database hosted on WAMP Server, which securely manages user accounts, ticket bookings, student pass details, payment records, and route information. This database-driven architecture ensures reliable data storage, quick access, and smooth integration with the frontend, enabling real-time updates for ticket availability, payment status, and route schedules.
